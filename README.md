# Aligning Music with Dynamic Time Warping Algorithm

Dynamic time warping is an algorithm for comparing how similar two time series are. It has many applications in a wide range of fields, including music. In this project, we attempt to apply time warping to simple melodies and see how it warps the music. We will verify the results visually (from a graph) and use the warping matrix to stretch/compress/shift parts of an audio file to align it with a similar one. Then we can listen to the resulting warped melody.
